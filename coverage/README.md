| üîß  | Path fixing                | Adjust paths as needed for accurate results        |

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Create an account on [Qlty Cloud](https://qlty.sh)
2. Add your repository as a project
3. Update your GitHub Actions workflow to upload code coverage:

```yaml
# ... Generate code coverage data from test execution ...

- uses: qltysh/qlty-action/coverage@v1
  with:
    oidc: true
    files: lcov.info
```

> [!NOTE]
> This uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication which avoids the need to install a Repository Secret in GitHub Actions.
>
> As an alternative to OIDC, you can obtain a Workspace or Project-level coverage tokens. See Examples below for more.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Requirements

To use this coverage uploader, you need an accounton [Qlty Cloud](https://qlty.sh) which offers code coverage reporting.

The Qlty Cloud offers free plans, including for commercial projects, with no limits on contributors.
